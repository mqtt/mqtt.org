MQTT is an OASIS standard for messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas, etc.


## Why MQTT? 

### Lightweight and Efficient

MQTT clients are very small, require minimal resources so can be used on small microcontrollers. MQTT message headers are small to optimize network bandwidth. 

### Bi-directional Communications

MQTT allows for messaging between device to cloud and cloud to device. This makes for easy broadcasting messages to groups of things.

### Scale to Millions of Things

MQTT can scale to connect with millions of IoT devices. 

### Reliable Message Delivery

Reliability of message delivery is important for many IoT use cases. This is why MQTT have 3 defined quality of service levels: 0 - at most once, 1- at least once, 2 - exactly once

### Support for Unreliable Networks

Many IoT devices connect over unreliable cellular networks. MQTT’s support for persistent sessions reduces the time to reconnect the client with the broker.

### Security Enabled

MQTT makes it easy to encrypt messages using TLS and authenticate clients using modern authentication protocols, such as OAuth.
